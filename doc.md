# RIT-Schedule-Maker

## Features
*Functioning calendar with days that highlight

*Event adding (Name of event and time of it)

## Difficulties
*Cocoapods was considered (JTCalendar), but its instructions were too inconsistent to be relied on and it was scrapped. Unfourtanately, this cost us a lot of time.

*Trying to figure out how to set up so each individual day to have its own table was a giant headache.

*Only one of us (Lydia) actually owned a mac, so consistency of work was hard to coordinate.

*Constant shifting of how to approach project led to time consumption.

*We overscoped. Hard.

## Work

*Nathan: Calendar Structure & Design

*Lydia: View setup

*Both: Code for table functionality & event adding
